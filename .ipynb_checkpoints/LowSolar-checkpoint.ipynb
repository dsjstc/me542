    "This is a common way to heat swimming pools.  Unfortunately, it's not safe to glaze the HDPE, because it can easily reach the plastic's softening (or even melting!) temperature, resulting in leaks at the joints.  This means its efficiency will be very poor at low OAT.\n",

    "There is very little data available on the performance of these systems.  I was lucky enough to find [this blog entry with measurements](https://rimstar.org/renewnrg/solar_pool_heater_diy_fp.htm#EFFICIENCY_CALC), for exactly the kind of coil I had in mind.  The measured results were:\n",

With no data point for a higher $\\Delta T$, all we can do is assume a similar efficiency slope as for an unglazed collector, at 1.07 %/degC.  Putting efficiency into the same y=mx+b form as for the other collectors, we find \n",
